SQL and Relational Algebra Challenge Question

Directions: Reference a standard Chinook database model

Question: A particular creator is looking for some short audio 
clips that are dramatic or suspenseful. Give the id, name, and duration 
(in milliseconds) of any tracks from the “Quick clips” playlist are labeled with the genre of dramatic or suspenseful. 

Part One: Construct a Relational Algebra query

playlistfiltered ← σ name='Quick clips' (playlist)
playlisttracks ← π trackid (playlistfiltered ⨝ playlisttrack)
genrefiltered ← σ name in ('Dramatic', 'Suspenseful') (genre)
tracksfiltered ← π trackid, name, milliseconds ((playlisttracks ⨝ track) ⨝ genrefiltered)

Part Two: Construct a SQL query 

select t.trackid, t.name, t.milliseconds
from track t
join playlist p on pt.playlistid = p.playlistid
join genre g on t.genreid = g.genreid
join playlistTrack pt on t.trackid = pt.trackid
where p.name = 'Quick clips'
and g.name in ('Dramatic', 'Suspenseful');
